	<h1><em>How to prepare lemon water</em></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Lemon water is a natural kind of juice, just a combination of lemon and water without any artificial ingredients that helps us from getting dehydrated. 
           As the making process is easy and helps in many ways to our body,hence I like it to have everyday.
